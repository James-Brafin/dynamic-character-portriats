**Dynamic Character Portraits** is a plugin for Content Patcher that allows for the dynamic generation of outfits for NPCs.
Not only does this come pre-equipped with all sorts of outfits, hairstyles, and accessories, the system makes it straightforward to 
add your own pieces as well.

* Add all Vanilla characters, and hopefully popular modded ones

Please note: Because it's been a year, my code's a mess, and I've made a lot of improvements on my workflow, I'm essentially starting from scratch on this.
I won't be adding more characters until I get the basic structure finalized, but once I do they should start coming pretty fast.

If you'd like a tutorial on my workflow for this process, please let me know! I'm happy to create one.
